# Using Proxy setup
There are a few options to connect a melcloud wifi adapter / procon as slave.
The slave works as normal and you are able to control the heatpump via the esp.

### Custom proxy pcb
[The easiest option is to use a custom pcb by @fonkse](https://github.com/gekkekoe/esphome-ecodan-hp/discussions/70#discussioncomment-11133291)

@fonkse created a pcb + wires and it is basically plug and play. This is the recommended hardware setup for proxy.

Select the `esp32s3-proxy2.yaml` as configuration in `ecodan-esphome.yaml`. Build and flash the firmware.

### Heishamon large V5
[Another option is to use a Heishamon v5 (large).](https://www.tindie.com/products/thehognl/heishamon-communication-pcb/
)
 This option also allows you to use ethernet instead of wifi and has two relay switches available that can be used.
Use the following diagram to create the connectors.

Heishamon has two connectors (large and small).
The large connector (bottom) is connected to the heatpump and the small (top) one is connected to the slave.

|                 | heishamon       |              |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| large connector | socket: B05B-XASK-1, connector: XAP-05V-1       | socket: B05B-PASK-1, connector: ST PAP-05V-S |
| small connector | socket: B05B-PASK-1, connector: ST PAP-05V-S    | socket: B05B-PASK-1, connector: ST PAP-05V-S |

Alternatively you can also rewire the melcloud wifi adapter / procon connector to match the pin layout and plug it into the small socket on the heishamomn board (You still need to create a cable for the large connector).

NOTE: The current version of heishamon V5 requires a 10kÎ© pull-up resistor on the RX line from the heat pump. It's recommended to solder it at the back side of the board.

Select the `esp32s3-heisamon.yaml` as configuration in `ecodan-esphome.yaml`. Build and flash the firmware. Connect the small connector to the slave and the large connector to the heatpump.

### Generic esp32 with two pair of RX/TX GPIO. 
I will be using a m5stack atom s3 lite as an example.
Use the following schematics to create the connectors.

|           | atoms3lite      |              |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
|           | grove female    | socket: B05B-PASK-1, connector: ST PAP-05V-S |
|           | pin header      | socket: B05B-PASK-1, connector: ST PAP-05V-S |

We do need to connect the 12v to the slave port.

Select the `esp32s3-proxy.yaml` as configuration in `ecodan-esphome.yaml`. Build and flash the firmware.
